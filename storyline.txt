US Botanic Garden
More than 200 years ago, George Washington had a vision for the capital city of the United States that included a botanic garden that would demonstrate and promote the importance of plants to the young nation. Established by the U.S. Congress in 1820, the U.S. Botanic Garden is one of the oldest botanic gardens in North America. The exhibits at the Botanic Gardens are a great way to learn about nature, no matter the weather outside!

National Museum of African American History and Culture
The National Museum of African American History and Culture is the only national museum devoted exclusively to the documentation of African American life, history, and culture. It was established by Act of Congress in 2003, following decades of efforts to promote and highlight the contributions of African Americans. Many of the Smithsonian museums can help you contextualize historical events, and this most recent addition (opened in 2016) is incredibly moving.
